1. Extract all files to the same folder.
2. It is best to put that folder in a C drive so that the path inside the various source codes are easy to read.
3. Ensure all the paths are written correctly inside the source code before you run the codes.(Different computers
different path, ensure the path is set correctly)
4. Because the images are all randomly selected, different results from the source codes would occur. Sometimes performances
are better, sometimes worse. Thus the results from the report vs results when running the code might be different. But as 
long as there is consistency in the result trend, it should be reasonable and valid.
5. Launch Jupyter notebook.
6. Locate the correct folder and open the various source codes using Jupyter notebook.(A reminder to ensure the paths inside
the source codes are changed correctly according to user's personal preference.)
7. Run the various source codes.
